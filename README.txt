Straw Poll Block

A simple block which allows you to conduct a straw poll with your students and users.
The configuration allows you to enter a question and up to six choices for the user to
pick from. The behaviour of the block can also be altered through some additional
options such as allowing the user to change their choice or restricting when the results
can be seen.
